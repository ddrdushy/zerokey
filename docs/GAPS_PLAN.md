## How this is organised

1. **Inventory** — every gap, by source document, with a one-line
   description, priority, and effort estimate (S = under 1 day,
   M = 1–3 days, L = 3+ days).
2. **Proposed slice sequence** — 11 slices that close the inventory in
   a sensible order. Each slice bundles gaps that share a layer
   (middleware, auth lifecycle, notifications, etc.) so the work
   compounds rather than scattering.
3. **Recommended next** — the first slice to take.

Anything *already shipped but mis-recorded as deferred* is called out
at the end so the BUILD_LOG can be corrected.

## Proposed slice sequence

Each slice is sized to ship in one session.

### ~~Slice 104 — Platform hardening~~ — shipped

Standardised error envelope, request id middleware (+ Celery
propagation + log enrichment), Sentry SDK, anon + user
throttles with `X-RateLimit-*` headers, django-axes lockout,
and 2FA session rotation. See BUILD_LOG entry for details.

### Slice 105 — Idempotency-Key enforcement

The biggest API correctness fix. Without it, a network-level retry on
`POST /v1/invoices/{id}/submit/` can result in two LHDN submissions.

- Decorator-based dedup (Redis-backed) for inbound POST/PUT/DELETE.
- Honours request body hash so a re-used key with a different body
  errors instead of silently returning the prior response.

**Effort: M.** Depends on Slice 104 for `request_id` to log retries
coherently.

### Slice 106 — Audit log integrity (the trust story)

The "publicly verifiable" claim in AUDIT_LOG_SPEC is hollow today —
signatures aren't computed. Single biggest brand-trust win.

- Ed25519 signing in `apps/audit/chain.py:record_event` via KMS Sign.
- Centralised action-type catalog (`apps/audit/actions.py`) replacing
  scattered string literals.
- `payload_version SMALLINT DEFAULT 1` on `AuditEvent`.

**Effort: M.** Independent.

### Slice 107 — Identity quality of life

Three small fixes that share the identity surface.

- Password reset + change flow (Django built-ins, hooked into existing
  notifications).
- Active session review + revoke (`/me/sessions` endpoint +
  `/dashboard/settings/security` UI).
- Customer master merge (one service function + endpoint; the
  matching logic already exists in `apps/connectors/`).

**Effort: M.** Depends on Slice 104 (envelope + throttling).

### Slice 108 — Notifications expansion

Foundation for security alerts in Slice 109.

- In-app notification feed (model + UI feed, builds on
  `NotificationBell` shell component).
- Outbound WhatsApp Business send via existing provider adapter
  (inbound is already wired in `apps/ingestion/whatsapp.py`).
- Security alert email templates (new device, password change, 2FA
  change, API key created/revoked).

**Effort: M–L.** Independent of 107.

### Slice 109 — Magic-link + login history + new-device alerts

All three share the authentication lifecycle, so they ship together.

- Magic-link sign-in flow (token → email → consume).
- `LoginHistory` model with IP + UA capture per successful auth.
- New-device detection (UA fingerprint + IP geo) → security alert
  (uses templates from Slice 108).

**Effort: L.** Depends on Slice 108.

### Slice 110 — File upload AV scan

- ClamAV (or managed equivalent) wired into the ingestion path
  before files reach S3.
- Quarantine bucket for failed scans.

**Effort: M.** Independent.

### Slice 111 — Help center + LHDN error decoder

The largest single deliverable in the gap list. Worth the effort —
doc explicitly calls it "high marketing value".

- Help article model + admin authoring surface.
- `/dashboard/help/{slug}` reading surface (existing route is a
  placeholder).
- LHDN error code decoder: hand-curated mapping of MyInvois error
  codes → plain-language explanation + remediation steps.

**Effort: L.**

### Slice 112 — API contract polish

Closes the API_DESIGN gaps that are non-blocking but matter for the
public-API story.

- Cursor-based pagination class as the DRF default.
- Resource-prefixed opaque IDs in serialiser output.
- Public `AuditEvent` and `UsageReport` API resources.

**Effort: M.** Depends on Slice 104.

### Slice 113 — Audit export bundle + public verifier

The customer-facing trust deliverable. Pairs with Slice 106.

- Tamper-evident JSON export bundle (events + cross-tenant
  intermediate hashes + signing public keys).
- Stand-alone Python verifier (open-sourced as a separate repo).

**Effort: L.** Depends on Slice 106.

### Slice 114 — Account deletion + data export self-serve

The PDPA-aligned customer right. Last because it is large and depends
on the audit redaction pipeline being in place.

- Self-serve full-account dump (all tenant data, S3 zip).
- Self-serve deletion trigger with a 30-day cooling-off window.
- Audit redaction job (replaces deleted-customer payloads with hashed
  references; preserves chain integrity).

**Effort: L.** Depends on Slice 106.

## Recommended next

With Slice 104 shipped, the natural next step is **Slice 105
(idempotency-key enforcement)** — it inherits the request id from 104
and closes the largest remaining API correctness gap (duplicate LHDN
submission risk on network retry).

The strategic alternate remains **Slice 106 (audit signatures)** —
without it, the "publicly verifiable audit chain" claim isn't true.
Independent of 104 and 105.

## Stale entries to correct in BUILD_LOG

Field-level PII encryption is **shipped** (Slice 95 — see
`apps/administration/fields.py:EncryptedCharField`/`EncryptedTextField`,
applied across `enrichment.CustomerMaster`, `submission.Invoice`
supplier+buyer PII, `identity.OIDCProvider.client_secret`). The
"deferred / not yet implemented" bullet for it should be removed from
the BUILD_LOG retrospective list.
